Now we can just select all of the numerical columns for modeling conveniently. Based on the data, we can try to use a simple machine learning model to predict.
The columns called "views", "likes", "dislikes" and "comment_count" might can be used to identify the video is trending or not as the label. And the others could be used as inputs.
```{r select useful column}
USvideos_ML <- USvideos_NNA %>%
  select(views, 
         likes, 
         dislikes, 
         comment_count, 
         category_id, 
         comments_disabled, 
         ratings_disabled, 
         video_error_or_removed,
         date_year,
         date_month,
         date_day,
         time_year,
         time_month,
         time_day,
         time_hour,
         time_minute,
         time_second,
         chr_row_num,
         pattern_num,
         chr_length)
USvideos_ML
```
